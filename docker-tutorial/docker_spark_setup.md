Sure, here's a step-by-step tutorial on setting up a machine learning project using Apache Spark, Docker, and Python.

Step 1: Set Up Docker
Install Docker: If you haven't already, install Docker from here.

Pull the Spark Docker Image: Open your terminal and run:
docker pull bitnami/spark:latest

Step 2: Create a Docker Compose File
Create a docker-compose.yml file to set up a Spark cluster.


Step 2: Create a Docker Compose File
Create a docker-compose.yml file to set up a Spark cluster.

master
version: '3.8'

services:
  spark-master:
    image: bitnami/spark:latest
    environment:
      - SPARK_MODE=master
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
      - "7077:7077"

  spark-worker:
    image: bitnami/spark:latest
    environment:
      - SPARK_MODE=worker
      - SPARK_MASTER_URL=spark://spark-master:7077
    depends_on:
      - spark-master
master

Step 3: Start the Spark Cluster
Run the following command in your terminal to start the Spark cluster:

docker-compose up -d

Step 4: Set Up Your Python Environment
Create a Virtual Environment:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate


Step 7: Access Spark UI
You can access the Spark UI at http://localhost:8080 to monitor your Spark jobs.

This tutorial sets up a basic environment for running machine learning tasks using Spark and Docker. You can expand on this by adding more complex data processing and machine learning tasks.
